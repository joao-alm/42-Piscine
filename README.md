# 🌟 42 Piscine Repository

This repository contains my **original attempt** and **future retry** for the **Piscine** at [42 Luxembourg School](https://42luxembourg.lu/fr/accueil/). The Piscine is an intensive, month-long coding bootcamp that challenges students in C programming and problem-solving.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **Piscine**  
   Contains the projects and solutions from my first attempt at the Piscine. This reflects my initial learning and problem-solving approach.

2. **Piscine_Retry**  
   A work-in-progress section where I will refine my previous solutions and tackle the Piscine challenges again with a stronger understanding of C programming and best practices.

Each section has individual project directories with README files detailing the project, setup instructions, and results.

## 📜 License

This repository is intended for educational and personal reference as part of the 42 School program. All projects are created for learning purposes and to fulfill the Piscine challenges.
